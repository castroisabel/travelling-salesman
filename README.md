# travelling-salesman

Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the travelling salesman problem consists of find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

For this problem, we use the following methods:

1 - Gurobi Optimizer

2 - Nearest Neighbor

3 - Farthest Insertion

to optimize the heuristic solutions, we use the 2-opt optimizer.
